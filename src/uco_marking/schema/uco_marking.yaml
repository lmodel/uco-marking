# CURIE namespaces (prefixes/base URI's) mappings of prefixes used in the body of
# the UCOLink Model specification are resolved using a specific precedence order,
# for use in the generation of the UCOLink Model context.jsonld mappings to
# namespaces. Any prefixes encountered in the UCOLink Model but not resolved by
# the following precedence sources, are anonymously declared by linkml as
# http://example.org/UNKNOWN/ rooted base URI's which should ideally be repaired
# in one of the precedence lists.
#
# 1. The following 'prefixes:' delimited list has first precedence in resolution.

      "Explicit specification of exactly which portions of a UCO object to apply MarkingDefinitions to.  Specific syntax for how to specify the UCO object portions is dependent on the particular syntactic serialization implementation (XML, JSON, etc.) of UCO and MUST be explicitly specified in a separate binding specification for that syntactic serialization implementation (e.g. a UCO XML Binding Specification)."

      A release-to marking is a grouping of characteristics unique to the expression of data MarkingDefinitions (restrictions, permissions, and other guidance for how data can be used and shared) to convey details of authorized persons and/or organizations to which to the associated content may be released.

  StatementMarking:

      A terms of use marking is a grouping of characteristics unique to the expression of data MarkingDefinitions (restrictions, permissions, and other guidance for how data can be used and shared) to convey details of a textual statement specifying the Terms of Use (that is, the conditions under which the content may be shared, applied, or otherwise used) of the marked content. An example of this would be used to communicate a simple statement, such as 'Acme Inc. is not responsible for the content of this file'.
